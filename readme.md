# Single Site Catalogue Search
Non-Prod / Infra use only. This gist has no means of being used in production.
It is a simple single page which loads the json at `catalogue.json` and makes it possible
to search through it based on the title values. 

It can be hosted in a static manner, e.g. through Amazon S3. 

The `url` value needs to be replaced with the host.
